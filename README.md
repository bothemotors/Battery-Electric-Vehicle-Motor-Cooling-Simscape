# **Battery Electric Vehicle Model With Motor Cooling in Simscape**
Copyright 2021 The MathWorks, Inc.

This example models a battery electric vehicle with a cooling system for
the motor.  It is used to size mechanical, electrical, and fluid
components in the vehicle.  The vehicle executes a passing maneuver and
the speed, torque, and temperature measurements are used to assess if the
system requirements are met.
